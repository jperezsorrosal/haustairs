This is a project I use to learn Scala language during the Hackership batch in Berlin 2015.

The idea is to build a small service that connects to social networks stream APIs and
aggregate the notifications it receives in a single stream. Then build a small web application to display the stream or connect it to 
a processing system like Spark.

## Houstairs is about

* Learning Scala language
* Connect to public API or public data
* Automatize
* Build tutorial / experience about the process and exprience in Hackership
